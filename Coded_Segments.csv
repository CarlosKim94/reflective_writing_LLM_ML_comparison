reflection_assignment_P1,Level 1,1,1,"I am a newbie in data science (DS). On the one hand, I have been working with experimental electroencephalography,  electrocardiography, respiratory, functional magnetic resonance, and behavioural data of human participants prior to  starting the Master program in DS.  "
reflection_assignment_P1,Level 1,1,1,"However, the handling of data in basic cognitive neuroscience research is usually  clearly defined and hardly any real world impact to the participants is at stake. The course Machine Learning (ML) for  DS introduced me to a more typical DS workflow and data sets. The knowledge accumulated in this course provided  me with the general understanding of DS practice.  "
reflection_assignment_P1,Level 1,1,1,"The HCDS course was largely aimed at a critical reflection of DS practice, as well as actionable suggestions for im-provement by means of human-centred design. The discussed topics were closely related to the ethical principles for  responsible AI, including promotion of human values, accountability, fairness and non-discrimination, transparency  and explainability as well as privacy [2]."
reflection_assignment_P1,Level 2 (a),1,1,"Among these topics, some messages particularly resonated with me and gave rise to some discussions in my close  environment, such as human reliance on ML decisions"
reflection_assignment_P1,Level 2 (a),1,1,"First of all, I became aware of the importance to transparently  document the values of the participants and stakeholders in a DS project as a prerequisite for reflexive and reproducible  practice."
reflection_assignment_P1,Level 4,1,1,"A closely related idea that was conveyed in the course and seemed essential to me was that data as such are  artificial. Even if it might seem so on the surface, they are not given by nature, but rather produced in a social and  ideological context. For example, studies about the health effects of being overweight are based on body mass index  which in itself is a social construct that creates the context for the data and enables weight bias. Therefore, not only  values, but also social meaning and expertise should be considered in every step of a DS practice."
reflection_assignment_P1,Level 2 (b),1,2,"Mixed-methods  research lends itself to this approach, as qualitative methods allow for contextualisation of quantitative data. Social  context, and thus a qualitative understanding, is equally important when considering fairness, a concept I was already  very aware of before the course. Although I would have previously thought that it is sufficient to compute some fairness metrics in order to evaluate the fairness of a ML model, I realised how uninformative the math behind the metrics is  when taken without context"
reflection_assignment_P1,Level 2 (b),2,2,"Another realisation that stuck with me was how poorly labeled and documented ML data  sets can be. As shown in the exercise, the South German credit data set contains an incorrect code table even though it is  so widely used [5]. Though it was not surprising to learn that human-labeled training data is not consistently following  the best practices of structured content analysis, I had to think about the consequences of potentially mislabeled data  sets for the models that are built upon them and their validity [4]"
reflection_assignment_P1,Level 2 (a),2,2,"Finally, I became even more aware of the need  for explanations and explanatory user interfaces for black box models. In this way, interpretability and transparency  as well as fairness checks can be achieved."
reflection_assignment_P1,Level 2 (b),2,2,"In general, due to my background in psychology, I found the research in  the area of human explainability needs very interesting, and read a couple of papers presented in the lecture. I was  intrigued by the problem of over- and under-reliance in ML systems and would like to learn more about its causes and  effects. I also found it curious that human and machine interaction does not necessarily improve the overall accuracy  of the decisions which I generally assumed to be the case [6]."
reflection_assignment_P1,Level 3,2,2,"The course therefore has caused a lot of reflection in me which I highly appreciate. I very honestly do not have  criticism for the lecture other that I wished we had more time to dive deeper into the topics. That being said, I enjoyed  the tempo and depth given the time limitation."
reflection_assignment_P1,Level 3,2,2,"In terms of the exercise, I probably would have enjoyed working on  a coherent project throughout the course rather than on disconnected assignments. I also found it beneficial to have  access to the code of other student groups, as it enabled comparing the approaches and learning from our peers."
reflection_assignment_P1,Level 1,2,2,"The topics of the HCDS course were conveniently linked to the stages of the basic reproducible workflow [1]. We were  introduced to reflection points and improved practices for each stage of a DS project as well as the potential biases  that can arise. Additionally, we attempted improving the usual DS pipeline in our homework assignments."
reflection_assignment_P1,Level 3,2,2,"As a means of integrating the new insights into my current DS practice, I would first and foremost ensure that my  projects are reproducible, among else by documenting every decision, from the values with which I approach them to  the reasons for choosing a particular ML algorithm. If possible in the given context, I would aim to make my work open-access, as long as the privacy of project participants can be adequately assured"
reflection_assignment_P1,Level 3,2,2,"Along the way, I would incorporate  qualitative research methods, such as ethnographic methods, especially to understand and capture the social context of  the data set. Not only could the data contain inconsistencies and pre-existing biases that reflect the social environment,  but understanding the data could also help create better and more accurate models. Were I to collect data myself and  employ human data labelling, I would attempt to follow the best practices of structured content analysis and create  thorough reflexive documentation of the data set created, e. g. in the form of data sheet [3]."
reflection_assignment_P1,Level 3,2,2,"The course also made  me aware of the emergent bias that arises when using ML models. Therefore, I believe it is important to analyse the  potential outcomes of a ML system in a given social setting and develop a vision for a fair system that could serve  as a target for a project."
reflection_assignment_P1,Level 3,2,2,"A large part of the course was devoted to designing explanatory interfaces for post-hoc  interpretability of nonlinear and/or complex ML models. This area was very new to me, but after the course I feel  equipped to argue that there should exist such interfaces aimed at the user mental model to begin with, and I have an  understanding how to approach the interaction design and its evaluation."
reflection_assignment_P1,Level 3,2,2,The course contents expanded my previous  knowledge of quantitative summative evaluation methods with a more contextualised iterative process of evaluation.
reflection_assignment_P1,Level 3,3,3,"As a result of the HCDS course, my future DS practice will be more mindful and reflexive. Since I don’t have that much  experience with DS yet and therefore no fixed habits, I feel the timing of the course was very optimal. I can integrate the  learned contents into my future practice very naturally and with great enthusiasm."
reflection_assignment_P1,Level 3,3,3,"Since I largely share the underlying  values of the course, I felt very little resistance throughout it, instead a lot of curiosity and engagement. There were  also several overlaps with aspects of psychology, my other field of study, which provided me with interesting points of  reflection or additional context. I believe the course conveyed the core of the HCDS approach and raised the standards  for DS practice that I had envisioned prior to it."
reflection_assignment_P1,Level 4,3,3,"It also made me realise the high personal responsibility that is involved  in being a DS practitioner. I can imagine that if I stay in academia, these standards will be easier to keep, while switching  to the private sector might prove this more challenging. In the competitive business environment, many compromises  likely have to be made. Nevertheless, I hope that whenever I will be working with human-related data, I will be able  to advocate and safeguard human dignity at all costs"
reflection_assignment_P1,Level 1,3,3,"I have attended all the lectures and seven exercise sessions (exercises 1-4, 6, 8, and 11) of the HCDS course."
reflection_assignment_P1,Level 1,3,3,Together with the revision of the course material I have spent approximately 35 hours on the assignment.
reflection_assignment_P1,Level 3,3,3,"I found  useful that I needed to revise the course material and summarise the aspects that moved me most. I did not find the  given structure of the essay particularly useful as I would have rather reduced it into three phases (by integrating  phase III into the neigbouring sections). Additionally, in my case it did not feel particularly meaningful to relate to my  current DS practice."
reflection_assignment_P2,Level 1,1,1,"There should be a basic understanding of some good data science practices. Most of the existing tools and frameworks  should be aware of, and should be leveraged based on individual’s knowledge. Hence ethically using the data and the  tools and frameworks that uses the data should be supervised and understood really well. Handling private data in a  non-ethical way could create a lot of privacy issues  
"
reflection_assignment_P2,Level 1,1,1,"In this era of rapid technological development, we are living in a “Data-fied World.” Data collection is a vital part of  nearly every aspect of our lives, from the phones in our pockets to the cars we drive. Almost every human behavior and  every operation we do with a tool like a computer can be collected as data. Over the years, as technology progressed and  we aimed for a better life, we began to use data generated from day-to-day actions to conduct complex analysis with  the help of strengthened computing powers and new analytical tools. Advanced technologies related to data science,  like Machine Learning and AI, have brought a lot of benefits to our life. However, as humans begin to step away from  hands-on analysis and let automated machines do most of the work for us, different issues such as fairness, privacy, and  representation emerge"
reflection_assignment_P2,Level 2 (b),1,1,"Coming from an Insurance Background, where I had worked as an Algorithm Developer where my role was to analyze  the data of the Policy Holders and using the data, write algorithms to calculate their final premiums. As a result of 7+  years of experience, I have understood the value of private data, and how it should be handled. Working as a responsible  developer where I was given the access of the Live (Production) Environment where I could see the actual data of the  legit customers  
"
reflection_assignment_P2,Level 4,1,2,"As an when my experience grew, I started to understand the consequences of mishandling the data.  I understood a lot of things, that why the Clients would give us RSA Tokens to login, as it provided a Two Factored  Authentication, so that the customer’s data will not be breached. There has been cases, mostly from the developers who 
Fig. 1. Steps to Data Responsibility Credit : https://www.bmc.com/blogs/data-ethics-responsibility/ 
were new to the working environments, who started to giving the customers some information to their private cell  phones thinking that this could be funny, but this created a lot of huge impact, and the developer was removed from  the Organization, and also the Insurance Company had to part the ways from the Company, there were some legal  issues too. Just one person who was inexperienced in handling the data, causes Millions of Loss to one of the Big-4  companies of the world  
"
reflection_assignment_P2,Level 3,2,2,"There is a reason, all huge companies have a strong policy on security, as they are really concerned about the Client’s  data. The misuses mostly happens by young fresh graduates who are not aware of the consequences, and hence the  Data Handling Ethics should also be taught (By Giving Such Examples) in Bachelors where students understand the  value of Data Mishandling"
reflection_assignment_P2,Level 1,2,2,"The course Human Centered Data Science (From Summer Semester 2022) clearly wanted the students to focus on the  Values of Computer Ethics, Data Ethics, Machine Ethics, Information Ethics, AI Ethics and Robot Ethics. We understood a  lot of categories of the AI Principles, and the differences between Repeatability, Reproducibility Replicability"
reflection_assignment_P2,Level 2 (b),2,3,"Publishing your research openly shows that we take the responsibility of the research, even though it is wrong. We understood  greater the count of public audience, it will encourage us to reflect on our values, assumptions and thought process,  while designing and publishing the projects.   
"
reflection_assignment_P2,Level 1,3,3,"We understood the Principles of FAIR Data, where the data should be easily find-able, inter-operable, accessible and  reusable. While uploading the data, we should utilize the DOI (Digital Object Identifiers) which gives a single point of  reference, if there is something wrong in it. Before sharing any data, the data needs to be licensed, so that it allows the  creator of the data, to give other people the right to share, use and build a documentation upon the data. We learnt  about a lot of Licensing Software, and also the key principles of our reproducible workflow"
reflection_assignment_P2,Level 1,3,3,"Along with learning about the Data Upload and re-using the data, we also understood a lot of data discrimination that  the AI Models pick, as they could be Gender Biased/ Race Biased. We learnt about some frameworks that minimized the  Data Bias, and helps to not discriminate based on the gender, race, ethnicity etc. We understood the fairness matrix,  which tells us how fair the trained model is, and how bias it has created for some ethnicity, gender etc."
reflection_assignment_P2,Level 2 (b),4,4,"There are a lot of topics that I had learnt in this course, even though I come with a lot of work experience in the field of  Data Science. I was already aware of Data Privacy, and how not to mis handle data - but this course taught me a lot  more than that.  
"
reflection_assignment_P2,Level 2 (b),4,4,"To be honest I was not aware of the Bias and fairness part. The Models that are being trained forms a  bias towards a certain classification (group) of people and show a bad fairness score. I learnt about a lot of packages on  how these bias is being handled with.  
"
reflection_assignment_P2,Level 2 (b),4,4,"Along with the bias and fairness score I also learnt on the importance of licensing  the data. Licensing the data, makes you liable to any of the error in the data and hence you try to be as accurate as 
possible."
reflection_assignment_P2,Level 3,4,4,"This course will definitely play a vital role for me when I work at the industry. I’ve been learning ethics since 8 years  now, because in all big organizations you have to mandatorily finish an yearly course/certification, but coming on to  this course there are new things which I have learnt.  
"
reflection_assignment_P2,Level 3,4,4,"As mentioned in the above Phase, I have learnt 2 new things,  about Bias and Data Licensing. I work on Satellite Data, where we do not have any information about the people and  thus there would not be any bias (But still would keep this in mind for the future)"
reflection_assignment_P2,Level 3,4,4,"Coming onto the data licensing,  since I have to manually crop a lot of Satellite Images (Sentinel, Landsat), I have personally created a lot of data (And  their labels). I have uploaded them in the Kaggle platform, and other GitHub pages. Now I would really love to explore  the Data Licensing part, as through this I would be more precise in generating the data, and my data can be reused by  many more people. Any misinformation will come back to me as there is one reference point for the data which I have  created"
reflection_assignment_P2,Level 2 (b),4,4,"Through this paragraph I would like to conclude my thinking towards the course Human Centered Data Science SS - 2022.  For me the Course for Partially Helpful as I mentioned a couple of times that I have been learning these things for past  8 years through the Organizations where I have worked in the past.  
"
reflection_assignment_P2,Level 3,4,4,"Rather than keeping this as a mandatory module  for Data Science Masters Course, this could be kept as an elective, as most of the people who have good number of  work experience are already aware of many things which were taught in the course. The assignments were really well  structured and caught us well since the basics (Helped People who are new to Data Science and Python Language). The  GitHub was amazingly well structured, and maintained. The Wiki section really helped us to pick up the assignments,  and there were rarely any questions in our mind.  
"
reflection_assignment_P2,Level 3,4,4,"There were few assignments where the packages were really old, outdated, and we had to spend a lot of time on those,  and instead of asking to implement 4-5 algorithms, may be implementing one of them could be more beneficial, as we  would get more time to explore research papers, materials to go through and understand more rather than focusing  on the deadline and just coding without having a gist of what is happening.  
"
reflection_assignment_P2,Level 3,4,4,"My suggestion would be to give students  more of literature to read, and then ask them write reflection or programming assignments on top of it. This way the  students will understand the fundamentals of what they are going to implement and how addition of real use cases are  the best way to explain students.  
"
reflection_assignment_P2,Level 2 (a),4,4,"Apart from these, the course was really nice, and thank you for the amazing assignment organization on GitHub,  and the Reflections"
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 2 (a),1,1,"It is a challenge to practice data science without proficient background knowledge of computer science. As graduated  from social science and economics, I can be the prototype for the young data scientist these days who does not have  enough technical skills but only full of passions. It is true that there are many candidates for the data science field,  especially new major related to data science has been established from university and the administration department  takes long time to review the potential students and decide the best fit for their university. However, this field did not  just pop up rather it is more appropriate to say that the deep discussion and study of data science have been proceeded  recently  
"
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 2 (b),1,1,"Data has been piled up since personal computer was commercialized but there was not enough knowledge  and technical skills to handle and analyze it. After decades, finally the desire to manage the big dataset could be  satisfied with the improve technology and the demand from society. This is also one of the reasons why I decided to go  graduate school. When first entering the university, my major was only about social science, public administration but  after studying for a year I found out that there’s not many analytic skills included in the coursework that I can apply  to comprehend the society. With the idea to obtain tools, I double majored in economics  
"
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 2 (b),1,1,"As being open to quantitative  analysis with economic study, I found out that there should be computational work added when deriving my study.  That ended up going to graduate school in data science which combines mathematical understanding of the world  and derive the results from implementing the idea in computer"
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 3,1,2,"Likewise, I’ve had solid idea to study my master study  however, it is not easy to maintain the pure passion because of the shortage of computational skills which results in  shallow study. For example, in the first semester I took “Machine Learning for Data Science” course which covers the  general study of machine learning including theory, implementation, and report. While doing project, it took more time  for me to implement ideas into codes, the work I’ve submitted omitted discussion about the process I made. There was  not sufficient reason why I chose specific ML model, the order of project procedure, and the method of preprocessing  data. This ended up making a shallow implementation work which any computer scientist would have been able to finish much faster. The difference between the computer science and data science is whether we focus on the analytic  skills or the analysis of the result. Unlike the computer science, data science could provide the deeper understanding  of any field of study which is sparkling part of this field that does not develop inside of the field rather connects and  cooperate with the other fields so that boost their improvement as well. However, what I had been doing was was  treating data science as the “black-box”, which is considered to be risky and did not give meaningful reason why there  should have been data science to solve a problem. "
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 2 (b),2,2,"After finishing the first semester with all mandatory courses, I  needed to study what lacks in study next semester. The main reason to sign up this course was to obtain the critical  tool to review my work and furthermore, explain the work to the others including non-specialists. I cannot agree more  that it is important to be able to communicate with the people about the work who is not scientists because this data  science is handling the data to get better comprehension of the world. Because the human-data science discuss how  should we treat the technical tool and let the others understand the work even without the knowledge of professional  skills, taking the course was inevitable."
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 3,2,2,"Human centered data science connects human handler with the automated machine that they are dealing with. Due to  the automated feature of machine learning, human can be easily detached from the process of it while only intervening  the start and the end of data analysis. However in this sense, data analysis would not be able to be accounted since  there is no human-decision process involved and it would be vague that if this can be considered as ”analysis” or  just acceptance of the result of computation from machines."
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 1,2,2,This course let the scientists to be responsible for the  machine learning process and prove the algorithms they used are accountable.
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 2 (a),2,2,"The course introduces how unreliable  the machine learning can be by introducing bias and discrimination in data science. Bias and discrimination can be  differentiated with the question if it is a social phenomenon or not. When talking about the bias, human centered  discussion treats it as a fact that there is an imbalance in dataset which would harm the logical derivation from the  machine learning. However, discrimination is the attribute that people with the biased idea have an impact in a society  which causes inequality inside of it. Interesting fact that I learned about this topic is that there are types of biases  which can explain how they are built. Data bias finds the reason how it is created from the data itself before they are  even used for analysis which could be constructed by the normative standard that people share. Bias is also created  while sampling procedure that they were collected for the analysis. Data processing bias talks about the construction  of imbalanced dataset when annotating data or sacrificing integrity of it while aggregating it. These data of different  types can be mitigated by some of the methods with the notion of making balanced dataset. The point is to provide  the context to data for scientist and the users who are not specialists."
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 1,2,2,"When the bias and discrimination has been dealt  at most in the data, it is the time to prepare reproducing data. The reason why this step is required is that it can show  the accountability of the scientist that they are transparent and responsible about their scientific work. Following the  FAIR principles, scientist are required to consider following points for support reproducing it: using data, sharing the  research, understanding the research. These points could be considered in any step of workflow of data science for  example in data acquisition, data processing, and data analysis. Each practice of how scientist can consider can be  given in example, like during the data processing, we need to give the label with appropriate names so that multiple  coders who will be reading it can understand it better. Also to make the data science work automated is also important  because the manual work on the data can easily ruin the integrity of the original research"
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 1,2,3,"With the balanced data and  the preparation for the reproducing it, the scientist needs to consider the interpretability and explanations of the work.  These two terms are better to be differentiated by interpretation referring to the understanding between the stakeholder and the ML while the explanations dealing the interactions between the scientist and the ML. First of all, explanation  is a mechanism to establish post-hoc interpretability. After the training of machines and the result of it, scientists has  been left with the duty to explain it to the stakeholders. Depending on the characteristics of audience that they are  meeting, there are different contexts and strategies required for the explanations. For example, if it is among the peer  scientists, the explanations would be more about to validate the training and test results like giving the workflow  how one prediction has been derived by analyzing the impact factor percentages of the predictions. However, if it  is a presentation for the investor, the contents must be focused on the aggregate graphs about the total predictions  and the relations between the problems assigned. Therefore we can summarize this concept to the expert, user, and  target mental model for explanations. Using the questions suggested from the mental models, the explanations of ML  can be integrated and more connecting between the audience and scientists. Likewise, the interpretation from the  stakeholders to the explanation from scientists also consider the human processing of information. Considering the  nature of the problems the the people encounter, different algorithms would be work to interpret it. Therefore the  task for the scientist is to intervene the interpretation process and make sure that it is done effectively, and one of  the method is suggested as ’Cognitive forcing function’. Applying this to the interpretation, scientist can make the  decision makers to engage analytically in decision making."
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 2 (b),3,3,"As mentioned above, before taking this course, the field human-centered data science is completely new so that there  was not a process for comparison between what I expected and learnt from the course. However, the terms obtained  from the course have now deeper understandings. For example, the reproducibility are differentiated with repeata-bility and replicability in the data science field. It is common that people use the three terms without differentiation.  Depending on the coherent machines or methods used, the term is divided with different meanings.  
"
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 1,3,3,". Also, the bias and  discrimination have different meanings which are reasonable. Unlike the bias, discrimination is a behavioral social  phenomenon that occurs based on the biased idea"
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 3,3,3,"To talk about how this achievement of new terms and knowledges  are applied during the data science, I would like to start it with the tasks given with south german credit data. The  data consists of financial and non-financial attributes of the customers for independent variables and the loan credits  for dependent variables. First of all, we were required to practice reproducibility while doing the analysis. From the  lectures, the reproducibility should be considered in the entire workflow of analysis which are data acquisition - data  processing - data analysis. In this task, as we were already given data, the part of data acquisition could not be modified.  But during the data processing what we have done was to change the column name to start with. The reason behind  this is because us as data scientists could not understand the column values with German column names and also, for  more scientist to reproduce it in their local environment, it is better to be translated. Also, during the whole process  except for translating german column name to english column we did not make any manual work which would ease  the reproducibility of work. What we could have done but did not was to script library used and methods for feature  engineering used, which would help the next scientists to understand the nature of the work. Also in the data analysis  step, there was no mention about the reason behind choosing a ML model and no representation of head rows of final  table after analysis which both could give more accountability of our project"
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 1,3,4,"Next, the fairness is also considered dur-ing the process. In data processing, we chose stratified sampling method so that as to keep the class ratios and resist  sampling bias. This is one of the type of bias mitigation which belongs to ’pre-processing’ related to data acquisition  and data processing steps. Also, by comparing the result between the dataset with and without ’PersonalStatus’ which  is about the sex and marriage status of the customer also shows the effort to check the balance of the dataset which leads to fairness of the analysis."
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 2 (b),4,4,"After the practice for reproducibility and fairness, we are given tasks for explanation  with LIME. This is one of the method that connects specialists and non-specialist as it bridges the gap with minimum  need for technical skills and explain the machine learning model work by specific standards. When I first learnt this  tool from the lecture, it was very new and interesting as it is coherent with the goal of the data science and the process  of it which is to analyze the phenomenon and gives contexts for the non-professionals to understand it together. LIME  could provide the information about the model validity, identifying complex models which would be a source for ex-plaining it to the stakeholders. Aggregating the practices experienced, I felt like given standards to be critical scientist."
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 2 (b),4,4,"Before the course, the machine learning is also closer to black box for me because there was not much critical thinking  involved in each step while replicating the other’s data science work with another dataset that I have. But as learning  each step of the workflow there are several points to be concerned, applying those tools would help me produce more  accountable work."
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 1,4,4,"With the information and knowledge I obtained in this course, I am able to analyze my past works with critical stan-dards and imagine how to improve it."
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 3,4,4,"One of my projects was natural language processing about the reflective texts  of students after learning experience. Due to the time constraints at that time, it was not made solid as expected. Pur-suing fairness of the analysis is one of them. The text data for analysis has been generated by human-labeling step  which was annotation of the stage of the sentence in reflection. One sentence was supposed to be annotated by 0 to  5 which represents the stage in reflective cycle. In that process, structured content analysis could help bias mitiga-tion. My teammates are given the same guideline texts and reference for the reflective cycle so that we were given  ”coding scheme”. But there was no calculation about the inter-annotator agreement or inter-rater reliability, which I  can imagine it improve the reliability of the work"
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 3,4,4,"Also to consider the reproducibility of the work, I could add more  comment and markdowns on the code file. Considering the support for using data, it is necessary to explain the data  and how the annotation has been proceeded probably inside of READme file. Also there was not many descriptions  about which libraries are used and chosen, adding those information in the markdown will help the other scientist to  understand and reproduce it in their local environment"
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 3,4,4,". I would like to add these because explanations help not only  the comprehension of the project but it also gives more reliability and accountability as the scientist who created the  project is being more responsible for their own work. Also for the explainability and interpretability, I would like to  adopt LIME and find out how the prediction of class labels has been made. Which words or contexts contributed the  most for classification would foster the understanding of the NLP model used and evaluate the model performance."
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 2 (b),4,4,Because the result of this project - building prediction model for classifying sentences was not effective because the  accuracy of models were always below 70 percents.
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 1,4,4,Also the potential users of the service made out of this prediction  model are teachers who would find out each student’s learning experience by checking their achievements up to which  reflective cycle they are based on the reflective writings. This would make manual work from teachers way less and  they can use their time to another tasks.
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 2 (a),4,4,To finishing this reflective assignment actually was effective to wrap  up what I learned from the course
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 1,4,5,"Unlike the format of programming assignments is familiar with, the tasks I needed to achieve was different from what data science project usually require. Therefore, the conversion of focus made it hard  to focus on the lecture contents but put more time to solve the problem suggested"
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 1,5,5,". While doing this essay assignment,  I reviewed all the lectures and assignments from my team and now I can picture the whole structure of this course."
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 2 (a),5,5,"Besides reviewing the contents, because the reflection included the action plan section, I could develop some strategies  that I can use for my next project."
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 2 (b),5,5,"Additionally, The course itself was helpful for the scientist like me who have not  experienced much yet so that the goal of the work can be easily distracted to just finish the task. Because the course  provided the tools to critically check their work in the entire workflow so that the result of analysis could be more  accountable"
reflection_assignment_P3,Level 3,5,5,"However, the programming assignments would be better to achieve by individuals. Because the tasks  given could not be really separated in phases but it is required to be done with the whole process together. In that  sense, team work was difficult because there is no task divided. In the last two weeks, assignments were given with  sub-tasks which were helpful for the team to work together with divided tasks."
reflection_assignment_P4,Level 1,1,1,"Data Science from an ethical point of view is becoming an important topic of discussion in the present times. All  companies and organizations must follow some ethical principles while using data and implementing data science  methods. When used properly, the power of data science can help make improve decision-making processes and make  a difference in the world. This course aimed to help students learn good data science practices and the impact these  technologies can have on the society we live in.  
"
reflection_assignment_P4,Level 2 (b),1,1,"I didn’t have any Data Science experience before coming to this master’s degree. I graduated as a Computer Scientist and 
have worked as a Developer for the past year. Hence, I am used to thinking as a developer not as a Data Analyst/Scientist. 
What I mean by that is that, as I was changing my career path, I also had to change my mindset or approach to different  problems. My approach was fairly simple and somehow similar to each task. The main focus was finishing in due time  and optimizing the solution without much reason on why the task was important. However, what I soon realized is that  to become a Data Scientist I had to add another step on my thought process, which is Analyzing the problem.  
"
reflection_assignment_P4,Level 2 (a),1,1,"In addition to completing my master’s, I was also lucky to find work as a working student Data Science consultant  which is helping me get a better view and understanding of the field. The problems I work with are not Human Centered  but there are still some concepts I learned over this course that I face daily like Reproducibility or Explainability.

"
reflection_assignment_P4,Level 1,2,2,"The course had many objectives to achieve in one semester. The core objective was focused on the fundamental  principles of Data Science in its Human implications, including important topics such as fairness, transparency,  privacy, accountability, etc. Besides learning the Ethical point of view of Data Science we indirectly got to learn some  communication skills. The course was very revolved around active participation, resulting in discussions during lectures  and as such, improving our oral skills and brainstorming capabilities."
reflection_assignment_P4,Level 2 (b),2,2,"I truly enjoyed this course for the easy fact that it showed realistic expectations of a Data Science role in real life. As I  said before, dealing with Data Science practices was something that I had not faced before coming to my master’s degree.  I had taken some online courses, but they don’t necessarily show the true hardships and obstacles a Data Scientist  has to pass on a daily basis."
reflection_assignment_P4,Level 2 (b),2,2,"I believe, and we also discussed this during the Seminars, that the most time-draining  and important activity of a Data Scientist is preparing the dataset in order to start analyzing and modeling. Online  courses and most of the courses in the University sort of neglect this part by giving the dataset already prepared and  with the correct data, which I believe is a wrong practice."
reflection_assignment_P4,Level 3,2,2,"Although this was not the main topic of this course, the  most important lesson I learned is to approach everything with a skeptical attitude. I learned this during one of the  Seminar projects we had to read a paper regarding a German Credit dataset. After submitting the project with my team,  I found out during the next seminar that not only the dataset, but also the paper was wrong. Before this event, I had not  thought that this could happen, and I would trust the results of scientific papers without questioning them. However,  now I know important concepts such as Replicability and Reproducibility so I can make sure that I don’t make the same  mistakes again.  
"
reflection_assignment_P4,Level 2 (b),2,2,"I believe that it’s easier to understand the concerns that misapplying Data Science practices represent using a Case  Study. I am going to take an example published by Princeton University that tackles some of the most important  lessons I learned during this course[1]. This case study illustrates the use of Data Science to find the reasons for the  high drop-out rate of Minerva University. Data Science is the best choice for finding patterns and providing effective  decisions using different statistical and predictive techniques. Therefore, the University cooperated with an external  Data Science company and provided them with an extensive amount of data on students like their behavior, academic  performance, attendance, and many more.  Although the company managed to create a model and find some clues on why the drop rate was so high, there were  some crucial ethical concerns that were not kept in mind. Privacy and security are two of the largest ethical problems  in the field of data science. Privacy means being able to control where and how your personal information is used. The  university had failed to inform the parents of this project and how their children’s data was going to be used, resulting  in a violation of privacy.  Another considerable ethical concern is discrimination and bias highlighted in the algorithms. The results generated  from the external company gave rise to some sensitive discussions. The students were not happy to be treated as research  subjects and to be compared among each other. Teachers said their experience was not being interpreted correctly by  the system. Furthermore, there was a lack of transparency in the model created that should be minimized by providing  access to the algorithm functionalities.  
"
reflection_assignment_P4,Level 1,2,3,"Finally, nowadays is becoming progressively important the Explainability of  machine learning algorithms. On many occasions, the machine learning models are treated as black boxes, especially in  complex Neural Networks. This results in not understanding the reasons behind the decision-making of the model.  Model interpretability is increasingly becoming more important, not only because of accountability but also to have actual facts and confidence on why the predictions make sense. All these problems can be solved and whilst the result  produced will be a less accurate model, it enables the Data Scientist to generate a model without violations."
reflection_assignment_P4,Level 3,3,3,"The entirety of this course changed the way I approach projects. The primary concern of each project is understanding  the problem and the target. Before this course, my main focus was on creating the best model with the highest accuracy  and lowest overfitting coefficients. However, now I understand that, while algorithms are typically performed in a way  beneficial for the world, there are also ethical issues that need to be considered.  Now I tend to analyze a project before making any programming steps, especially in a sense of checking about fairness  or bias. Obviously, this is just a first step and there are statistical ways for finding bias or fairness. One which we learned  during the seminar was to check the model’s prediction accuracy while interchanging sensitive features like gender. If  the accuracy changes if we change the gender feature, we can confidently say that the model is biased."
reflection_assignment_P4,Level 3,3,3,"As I mentioned before, I believe that the most important lesson I learned is to take everything with a grain of salt,  which essentially boils down to actively thinking (reflecting) about every part of the project.  
"
reflection_assignment_P4,Level 4,3,3,"The first concern, to begin  with, is to check whether the dataset is correct and have a clear understanding of it. What I also feel is important is the  impact the project can have on a population or worldwide if it’s a big project. Morality is very important to me, and I  don’t want to be part of a team that doesn’t consider the outcome of their work.  
"
reflection_assignment_P4,Level 3,3,3,"The next steps would be working diligently and trying to avoid as much bias as possible and making the model fair by  removing sensitive variables or features. Furthermore, the model needs to be explainable so that we understand the  decision-making process of the algorithm. This also serves as another step for mitigating bias.  
"
reflection_assignment_P4,Level 3,3,3,"Aside from learning the ethical point of view of Data Science, we additionally learned how important good documentation  is and making the project reproducible.  
"
reflection_assignment_P4,Level 3,3,3,"I believe this is a huge improvement in my Data Science practice. Although  it is much more work, the result feels more genuine and something to be proud of, which is great as we have to be  accountable for every project we make."
reflection_assignment_P4,Level 2 (a),3,3,"There is no doubt that data is an immense resource that we can all benefit from. However, it is important that we  maintain an ethical mindset at all levels."
reflection_assignment_P4,Level 2 (a),3,3,"This course helped me get a better insight into the world of data science. I  hope that I get to experience more courses that show real-life examples and experiences with different problems to  overcome instead of artificially prepared school exercises  
"
reflection_assignment_P4,Level 2 (b),3,3,"I didn’t necessarily find this assignment useful but that may be because of the approach I took on it. I used this  assignment as means of telling what I learned without going through the material all over again. This took me around  10 hours to complete, distributed in 3 days."
reflection_assignment_P5,Level 3,2,2,"As might be the case with other students, I do not happen to have a lot experience in real world  data science scenarios. During my courses with Tim Landgraf and Frank Noé the students learned  mathematically very complex models, and proceeded to use them on very well studied machine  learning problems. These problems are ”vacuum sealed” in a manner of speaking. They are for  students to practice on, and do not impact the outside world.  This has made my personal data science practices different than what I imagine them to be  out there in the ”real world”."
reflection_assignment_P5,Level 3,2,2,"My data science context has been to learn the complex models and  to pass the assignments and exams. As such, I never had to worry about people being impacted  about my decisions. The only thing affected by my questionable decision not to document my  code properly would be my sanity at some point down the line."
reflection_assignment_P5,Level 3,2,2,"This has possibly lead me to neglect some parts of my data science practices, namely everything  revolving around humans. This is possibly a sub-optimal entry scenario for this course, as one  usually learns how to improve one’s behaviour better when one has encountered certain problems  before, as opposed to being taught dogmatically how to get it right from the get go."
reflection_assignment_P5,Level 2 (b),2,2,"At the very beginning of the course, when the classroom was still packed, I did not yet understand  what the goal of the course was. I came in with the expectation that this was going to be your  average ethics course. This thought was born out of the fact that the data science students are  getting this course credited as if it was an ethics course. It was only much later and thanks to  fruitful discussions with XXX that I comprehended that the course is about teaching ways to bring  the human user - possibly a lay user - back into the core of a machine learning application. Fairness  and ethics of course being an important part of this, but only a piece of the puzzle nonetheless."
reflection_assignment_P5,Level 2 (a),2,2,"The course was structured around a framework of concepts, which we would define and discuss 
with examples. The most important ones to me I listed in the Keywords section, but will repeat 
here: Reproducibility, Fairness, Interpretability, Explanability, User-Needs.  
"
reflection_assignment_P5,Level 3,2,2,"At this point I have to be a little critical. In my opinion the way to present some of these concepts  was too rigid, and the examples were not relatable to me. I understand that when one has worked  with these concept for years they seem like second nature. However, for me personally a big and  drawn out definition is not very memorable. By the time we reached the end of the definition I  had already forgotten the beginning. I would have preferred the concepts to have been presented  in a more dynamic way. I would have understood the concepts better if they had been taught  from a ”in the shoes of a professional with a specific problem” perspective, and then we could  have developed the concepts together, with some guidance."
reflection_assignment_P5,Level 4,3,3,"Despite this, I still managed to absorb some valuable takeaways. The main one being to doc-ument every single step of the data science pipeline. Document the dataset, document the steps  required to reach a conclusion so that others can reproduce the results. Document the statistical  analysis carried out to asses the fairness of a model. Document the model used and how to inter-pret it. Should interpretation not inherently be possible, provide a local approximation to at least  give an intuition of an interpretation. Document how to explain your model to yourself and your  peers, and to the end users. Document if and how your work can be used by other users to work  on their own problems. 
The consequences are that both the expert and the lay user will be able to work with the data  science model much better on every step of the pipeline. Additionally members of society affected  by these decision can understand the machine learning process better, and protest decisions that  they deem wrong. 
There is, however, a downside to all of this. It takes massive amounts of time, effort and money  to do this and as such the experts doing this work often cut corners to the detriment of themselves,  but especially to the detriment of the lay users.  Additionally to parties not interested in the good of society, but rather their own bottom line,  this much transparency is not always desired. Whether this is justified or not is not a question  for this course, but perhaps more of a philosophical question."
reflection_assignment_P5,Level 2 (a),3,3,"Unfortunately, I had never looked into the human centered aspects of data science before, as such  I cannot relate my learning to any previous experiences. The first experiences I made were thus  with the exercises from the class."
reflection_assignment_P5,Level 2 (b),3,3,"Unfortunately once more, these experiences were mainly frustrating. I did not like the design of  the exercises, they seemed very detached from reality. This may be unavoidable, as reality is very 
difficult to neatly pack up into an exercise, yet still deeply unsatisfactory. I will allow myself some  honesty here: I despised both the case study reviews, as well as the programming assignments.  The case studies were terribly written and the discussion in the class turned out to be super 
hollow, as it was squeezed into the last five minutes.  
"
reflection_assignment_P5,Level 3,3,4,"The programming was worse, it soaked up massive amount of time on understanding how to  use a framework that I will likely never use again. Additionally, as XXX has already pointed out,  the German Credit Dataset was a bad choice for the course for many reasons. Here are two:  Firstly, the dataset is from before I was born, and there is no valid reason not to use a more  realistic dataset for this day and age. Secondly, it was impossible to train a good qualifier, and as such all the concepts from the  lecture could not really be applied. What good is it to explain, interpret, and test the fairness of  a really bad algorithm? Hence, the learning effect of the exercises was not what had I hoped it to 
be. "
reflection_assignment_P5,Level 2 (b),4,4,"Whether my views on bias, fairness and ethics have changed I cannot say with certainty. I  can only speculate that I already subconsciously had a solid moral compass, and don’t think my  fundamental views on these matters have changed much"
reflection_assignment_P5,Level 3,4,4,"On a more uplifting note, I do think that the course has brought these important concepts to  the forefront of my mind. So hopefully when I do get hired at a major company - I have no plans  to work at a university, startup, etc. - I can be more mindful of when things are not going in the  right direction, and implement the concepts into my workflow to improve my models."
reflection_assignment_P5,Level 3,4,4,"Here we enter the realm of pure speculation. 
Let’s assume that I end up working in the software department of some large company. I hope to  be in a position, where I work on a specific technical aspect of a company project. For example if  the company I work in has a database of customers, one job would be to help optimize the database,  such that queries work faster. The consequence would be that customers possibly receive faster,  better service. 
Assuming I did end up carrying large responsibility with my decisions over consequences for  people, I would try to be as fair and unbiased as I possibly could. I would perform a thorough  statistical analysis of whether my product was fair, and would try to be as transparent as possible  with the customers, so they can understand the decision. If they require explanations, I would  make sure they have access to quality documentation, as well as support from my company.  The stakeholders have a right to understand what, why, and how my product is doing what it’s 
doing, and what the consequences are. I think these improved practices go a long way in achieving  that goal.  
"
reflection_assignment_P5,Level 2 (a),4,4,"In conclusion the course - which I always attended except on the last week - made me more 
mindful of many important concepts putting the human in the center of the data science pipeline."
reflection_assignment_P5,Level 2 (b),4,4,"I spent the best part of a day on this exercise and think it useful to look back on what we have  done in the course, the good as well as the bad. This reinforces the concepts. Reflection is a tool  that I value in my daily life, and this is no exception."
reflection_assignment_P6,Level 1,1,1,"Before taking the Human Centered Data Science 22 course, I had more than two years of industry   experience as a Machine Learning Engineer in a phishing detection firm. Further, I took several   data science courses in my bachelor’s, like Pattern Recognition, Information Retrieval, Image   processing, and Computation Intelligence, which were particularly focused on learning Data   Science (DS) algorithms. I did several DS projects in the past related to the cyber security   industry, biomedical industry, and traditional image processing. Even in my ongoing master’s   degree, I have already taken the Machine Learning for Data Science course in my first semester.   The reason why I am mentioning all of these is that readers can get an idea regarding my profile   and can confidently assume that I have moderate exposure to the DS life cycle  
"
reflection_assignment_P6,Level 1,1,1,"Let’s start with my bachelor’s thesis, the primary goal of this project was to classify malware   families. BIG 2015 malware data set was used in this project in which two non-executable files   were present against each malware, one was a byte file, and another was ASM (assembly code)   file. Features were extracted from byte files using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and   discriminative opcode (operation code) features were selected from ASM files using a wrapper-based mechanism, where SVM was used as a classifier. Finally, the hybrid feature space was   used to train a multilayer perceptron (MLP), which classified all the nine different malware families   with good accuracy. One of the challenges that I faced during this project was the data was highly   unbalanced, and one class had a low number of samples i.e., 34 as compared to other classes   having an average of 1000 samples. And we resolved this by giving extra error weightage to the   low sample class."
reflection_assignment_P6,Level 1,1,1,"After my bachelor's degree, I got a job in a Phishing Detection company where I worked as an   Associate Machine Learning Engineer in the Data Science Team. The company had its detection   software which they sell to the customers. Their detection software monitors all the in-going and   out-going traffic of the customers, and whenever the user landed on a malicious website, the   software blocks the web link or warns the customers. During my tenure in this job, my   responsibility was to enhance their zero-day phishing detection rate; which itself was a very broad   problem. We design multiple classifiers to cater to this problem focusing on some specific website   categories, just for example one classifier for Microsoft login pages and another one for   cryptocurrency fraud webpages. And the data we received for training the machine learning   models are customers' opened websites, and the annotator team labels the websites and provides   clean data to the machine learning engineer. And according to the company’s privacy policy, the   data we got for models were without a single bit of customer information (i.e., IP address)."
reflection_assignment_P6,Level 3,2,2,"And another interesting project that I recently did was a segmentation of the skin lesions in the   winter term 21/22 during my Introduction to the Profile Areas (Data Science) course. The problem   we faced in this project was that the dataset images contain skin black hairs, which our models   classify as a lesion region too. Our models were only learning the dark colors to classify lesions.   But now, after taking the Human Centered course, I can wonder how bad this classification was,   and we’ll surely talk about this in the later phase 3 as well."
reflection_assignment_P6,Level 2 (a),2,2,"Without any doubt, I am truly grateful that I found this Human Centered Data Science course in   my course bucket. Besides this, I have learned a lot in this subject, and it has changed my views   on the different aspects of Data Science starting from the collection of the dataset for machine   learning models to the delivery of the projects to customers or clients."
reflection_assignment_P6,Level 3,2,2,"This subject has shaped my views on the ethical perspective of any project. Like, I read these   articles at the very start of my journey towards DS having titles starting from AI is bad,   Autonomous weapons use advanced AI to kill humans, People are losing jobs due to AI and et   cetera, et cetera. Now, I know where the problem starts; people need to write some code of   ethics before doing any project, like will these Autonomous weapons only use against terrorists?   or someone can also use them in warzones, hence killing innocent people. And if somehow,   someone makes wrong use of the weapon, then who will be accountable?"
reflection_assignment_P6,Level 2 (b),2,2,"This subject also touches on the topic of reproducibility and licenses of scripts, which I already   knew from my previous job where we practice this like documenting each and everything on the   Confluence tool; so the new employee can easily understand everything. But yes, it’s a very   important topic.  
"
reflection_assignment_P6,Level 2 (b),2,2,"During the course, I also learned about biases and fairness. Before that, I had   just an overview of the term bias, and this course has introduced me to how it can affect the   entire outcome of the project by still giving good accuracy  
"
reflection_assignment_P6,Level 2 (a),2,2,"I have never studied explainable AI   (XI) before, this course not only highlighted it but also briefly explain how to show it to the   customers or end users, which has surely changed my thinking and ongoing practices methods"
reflection_assignment_P6,Level 3,2,2,"As I mentioned in the previous phase, this course has reshaped my decision-making toward   machine learning problems. Like I did this project on skin lesion segmentation in the previous   semester. The dataset was very clean, containing regions of infected skin, the only noise we   encounter was the skin black hair, and some dark shadow regions in some images, but in the   end, our model was able to do good segmentation with a good score. Now, after studying this   HCDS subject, I revisited the project and notice that the dataset we used only has images of   yellowish, light brown, and reddish skin color, not even a single image having the skin of black or   dark brown color. So, now I am thinking that the dataset is highly biased towards some skin colors   and not even practical in the real life. I know people/RESEARCHERS will still use these kinds of   datasets, do their extensive research, and maybe succeed to publish their work may be in a good   journal. But they are not solving any practical problems. I think we need to declare some good   ethics for preparing skin-related datasets. And this is the level of thinking that the HCDS course   has implanted into me."
reflection_assignment_P6,Level 3,3,3,"Recently, I got a job in berlin too as a Machine Learning Engineer. My previous employer was a   product base company, and I never had to face the clients directly. In contrast, my current   employer is a service-based company, where I’ll be engaged in projects with clients from   prototypes to continuous integration and delivery. And these new learnings will surely help me to   better deal with the client. Now, I know what I need to document regarding ethics and   accountability before taking on any project. I know biasness and protected attributes, which I’ll   surely use if get the chance to work on such datasets. During the prototypes phase, I’ll have the   understanding of when and which interpretability method to use and how deeper to go depending   on the technical knowledge of the clients, and will refrain them from making false assumptions   about the model. These new learnings will make my future project lifecycle more defined and   refined and have prepared me to visualize the problems from a totally different perspective."
reflection_assignment_P6,Level 2 (b),3,3,"I am very slow when it comes to writing, but it took me around 12 hours including brainstorming   and putting it on paper. I find this assignment very useful because it evaluated my new learning   about Human Centered Data Science. It made me confident that I am taking a lot from this course.   And I appreciate that the assignment itself was very long, but a proper timeframe was given   especially after the exam period.  
"
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 1,1,1,I aended the initial lectures and tutorials in human-centered data science and skipped the last few. For the last few  missed lectures I looked into the slides in order to complete my tutorial assignments. I aended all the interactive  classes for reection without skipping any.
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 2 (a),1,1,"At the beginning of the course I considered this course to be more theoretical focussing on just the principles in  data science and how it aects human interaction with the robots. However, practical exploration of the contents of  human-centered data science using the datasets in tutorials was a more engaging approach which I found quite useful.  
"
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 2 (a),1,1,During the assignments certain goals of the assignments were repetitive and few were slightly irrelevant to the  concepts of human-centered data science.
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 2 (b),1,1,"Various interactive sessions on reectiveness assignments was interesting as I was able to gather numerous interesting  opinions on the topic from the other students. I was also able to think out of the box due to the diversied answers on a 
topic."
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 3,1,1,Although human-centered data science provided the seeds for the ethical practices in the future I think before  entering into industrial practice all are obliged to comply with the rules of the legal documentation which states all the  concepts thought in the course. erefore it becomes repetitive in the future.
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 1,1,1,"A practice is always necessary and eventhough the industrial practices follow legal documentations before entering  into data science, years of hand on practice with ethical principles abiding by the human-centered data science will  surely come in handy in the future. erefore this course provides the foundation for certain practices in the near  future.  
"
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 1,1,1,Human centered data science is focussed on catering both human-centered perspectives as well as the data scientic  perspectives. e integration of both constitutes the best practices in data science precisely termed as human centered  data science
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 1,1,1,"Building, establishing and growing a data science practice takes various factors into consideration. Data Acquisition  is one of the main stages, where the data can be gathered from sources such as kaggle, github, google or any other  source. e data collected has to be of some meaning. ere shouldn’t be any meaningless data records. A proper  formulation of the question is important even before searching for data from any of the sources. Understanding the  dataset is extremely important to proceed with the workow."
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 1,2,2,"Pre-processing the dataset is the next important factor to work with the dataset. Replacing the missing values,  dropping unnecessary rows or columns are some of the major considerations which need to be addressed while  preprocessing the data"
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 1,2,2,Once the data is cleansed then we need to shi on to model selection. Choosing the best model  denes the purpose of data science. e entire success of the project depends on how we combine our model with that  of the dataset.
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 1,2,2,Finally validation is the next key step to improve the eciency of the model. ese practices are the common  approaches in data science.
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 1,2,2,Although these practices may seem simple once we begin working with the dataset there are several complications  which need to be handled with proper solution. While we try to understand the data we may nd that few of the  column names are completely irrelevant and we need to rename them for beer understanding.  e records in the dataset are not limited to any particular language. Especially when we are working with  Natural Language Processing(NLP) we may face a situation where language conversion is a must. If this is ignored  then proceeding with the dataset may result in misconception of certain details resulting in failure
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 1,2,2,"Stable working  environment with proper updated or suitable versions of libraries are important while working with the dataset.  Non-updated library versions may raise errors which tends to lag the time making it more demanding to work with.  Having a proper structured workow is the key in developing a successful data science project.  
"
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 2 (a),2,2,"erefore, when the steps of Data Acquisition, Data Pre-processing, Model Selection and Validation are practised  with perfection we may get beer results and the success rate is prey high."
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 2 (b),2,2,"Ethical considerations in human-centered data science are oen ignored as people may term it to be just a theoretical  fact. However, when we consider certain cases where a person gets wrongly accused of a crime which he/she never  commied just because a machine was biassed to the race then the actual question as to how crucial human-centered  data science turns out to be more useful.  One of the leading supply chain company which used AI for hiring employees found out that their system was  extremely biassed against women as the number of resumes obtained in the last ten years were mostly men. None  would have expected such a error by the AI system.  At times prediction of AI system started becoming more oensive as a major photo app termed a certained group of  people as gorillas. is created a revolt among certain group of people.  ese real life incidents made sure that human-centered data science is not an approach which is to be taken lightly"
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 2 (a),2,2,"All along, the data science practice was all about manipulation of data to acquire beer results but when we question  Why? Or What? We tend to stammer. Data science practice should be more human-centred. It needs to answer the  exploitation of society or how human interference brings a change to what we are dealing with.  
"
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 1,2,2,"Scaling up qualitative analysis, incorporating values and principles and highlighting the commonalities are few  factors which answers the question to why and what the data science practice actually plans to achieve.  
"
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 1,2,3,"When we are  working with datas we tend to ignore the existing bias. is may be gender or racial biases.  To be more specic, when we had to work with German credit data,the results obtained were more favourable  to male gender which clearly was a major gender bias. Such biases which were once ignored were starting to gain  aention. is practice of dealing with biases was dened as accountability.   
"
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 2 (a),3,3,"Transparency is another key consideration which denes how human interference can challenge the predictions  of the model. Evidence as to why the predictions are discriminated against must be provided by humans to ensure  fairness in computation. e violation of social context by the data-driven systems must be known in advance and  must be handled eectively  
"
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 1,3,3,"When the goal of data science was providing ecient results for future prediction we were now able to inculcate  certain practices such as transparency, accountability, ethical values, security and reproducibility. Furthermore, all  these factors were added on to the existing practices to enable human centred data science practice.  
"
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 1,3,3,"Initially, in a data science practice ethical considerations are usually ignored from a students perspective. e main  focus is always on deriving the desired results for the formulated question. erefore, bias, fairness and other metrics go  unnoticed. However, aer completion of Human-centred Data Science a wide range of aspects were closely considered  while approaching the problem. Anonymization and decoupling practices which are responsible for enforcing privacy  were included while working on the problem.

"
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 1,3,3,"Multi-label classication problems were one-hot encoded for  exhibiting ethics and sustaining principles within the reach. Following certain legal documentation routines were also  thoroughly looked into once aer completion of the project.  
"
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 1,3,3,"Importance of reproducibility was a human-centered  oriented concept which was used in the projects to gather and improve the quality of work by gaining insights from  public opinions.  
"
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 1,3,3,"Fairness in practice is the most under-rated practice which all of us fail to follow. Once it is achieved it can improve  traceability, helps in auditability and withholds compliance with legal frameworks.  
"
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 1,3,3,"Previous practice lacked signicant balance between inclusion of principles and provision of stable results for the  provided dataset. However, when certain measures were brought into consideration the trade-o between the output  and legal considerations were acceptable. So, the current data science practice emphasised more on scaling up qualitative  analysis and pointing out on commonalities thereby strictly abiding my certain ethnographies.  
"
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 3,3,3,"Although following rules are considered to be morals, adapting them is not easy as it seems. ere is always malpractice  while we tend to adapt towards a certain change.  Any rules can be modied or manipulated as per the needs of the individual or for personal reasons. A combined  strategy to adapt to certain rules which are ready to be abided by a large mass of people is a dicult plan to execute. It  will only result in mere chaos among people.  Any ethical principle which when given an option to revise itself denotes that it is not a stable one. Instead of  dumping or shrinking the ethical principles it is always beer to cope with the existing ones.  is process of mixing and matching mal practice creates the question as to how to actually follow these legislative  rules in an AI practice environment."
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 3,4,4,"Rather than working more on problem oriented problems the desire to work more towards problem complied principle  oriented ways is how the change in practice can be enforced. While checking for the eciency of the model we fail to  check for its safety, privacy and other important factors where humans role are put at stake. e technology resulting  tragic accidents are not simply errors but ignorance on certain factors such as discrimination and complete avoidance  of transparency to hide the truth behind the working of the model. 
Only when an accident or mistake occurs do we realize about the failure of the model. If only the transparency was  prevailed the entire correction could have been implemented a lot earlier than the expected failure provideding an  ecient AI model instead of a failure one.  A self planted mistake yet manipulated in the eyes of the audience is how these non-sustainable products reach  the market and put lives at risk. Inclusion of highly important ethical ground rules and ignoring the minor rules does  not justify the hidden aws pertaining within the model. Discrimation by race or gender no maer how trivial the  condition is, having this fairly judged is how a model needs to be performed.  
"
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 3,4,4,"Data science practice was seen as an act of serving future predictions for providing beer results for the formulated  question. But when we need to provide a beer ecient model, any sort of manipulation can be done completely hidden  to the eyes of the audience. But when the question of why indulge in such practice evolves it becomes harder to answer."
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 4,4,4,Social nuances have shown how important it is to have a fairly judged trial amidst the discriminated society. Every  ignored minor judgemental action in the society may create a serious impact on the lives of certain individuals or even  a certain community of people. Technology is no exception to this. Ignorance of these from a technical point of view  may complicate things more and more. A biased predictable machine is never appreciated by any individual. Everyone  needs a more reliable AI environment where no discriminations are prevailed.
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 3,4,4,"As a data scientist we have an option to eradicate biases by following certain practices such as accountability,  decoupling, post-hoc inter predictability and other heuristic evaluations. Documenting these projects can help in the  beerment of the next investigator who wishes to follow the same. Practising ethnographical principles may provide a  more rm stance to your accomplished work.  
"
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 3,4,4,"ough these practices may make you think that it is not going to make a dierence in the overall work we must  understand that it is always these small details which always make the biggest dierence. Aer completely accepting and  using these practices we can ensure that the consequence of these choices will benet the society. Legal considerations  will always be satised. Disruption of privacy can be avoided and encryption of data will always prevail.  
"
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 3,4,4,"Human-centered data science approach taught us about the considerations of ethical principles and inculcating them  in a data science environment. However currently all companies have ensured and have taken legal oaths while  implementing a data science practice. erefore, this basic human-centered approach has defaultly been followed in an  industrial practice. Although, as a student I have learnt to include these considerations in my further practices, the  importance of them would eventually get a hold of me when I start using them in higher environments."
reflection_assignment_P7,Level 3,4,5,"is assignment  although aimed at providing reective opinions on the subject it only emphasised more on previously existing practices  with extra principle components. Clubbing all the gained knowledge was time consuming. Although this seems like an easy task when we try to provide an analytical approach to this more understanding on the subject as well as inclusion  of our previous knowledge on the subject may make things more dicult. I had to make several corrections before  geing a hold on the ow of the topics. However, by the end this reective report made me realise the importance of  human-centered approach in an industrial practice."
reflection_assignment_P8,Level 2 (a),1,1,"Before attending this course, I used to see Data Science as a set of basic principles that support the extraction of  information and knowledge from data by combining multiple disciplines such as statistics, mathematics, computer  science, and information science. Then applying this knowledge and insights from that data to solve problems in  different application areas. Similarly, when it comes to the role of a data scientist, I had this mainstream apprehension  in my mind that their duties include developing strategies for analyzing data, preparing data for analysis, exploring and 
visualizing data, building models with data using programming languages, such as Python and R, and deploying models  into applications. Being in this field for over a year now, I would also not resist to mention the key challenges a data  scientist faces at every step of their working progress that are most common amongst us and are basic pain-points  that could be highlighted  
"
reflection_assignment_P8,Level 1,1,2," As a student of MSc. Data Science I have worked on several projects so far and even as  a working student in the same field I have come across multiple matters that are common and fundamental in this  discipline. To begin with, finding the relative data and to consolidate the information in a single place making sure, at  the same time, that the available tremendous amount is of our use and could be used to derive the key insights we are  looking for, and that it could be accommodated in relatively cheap storage. Secondly, security and compliance issues  make it difficult for data scientists to access datasets. Confidential data is becoming vulnerable to cyberattacks due to  transitioning into cyber cloud management, as a result, data scientists are struggling to get consent to use the data,  which drastically slows down our work. Once these problems get sorted, then comes the understanding of datasets. 
Author’s address: XXX 
As the data in these sets are in raw format, for examples, column names are very unusual, there are a lot of missing  values, there is no ownership over datasets within organizations, and finding the person that knows the meaning of the  column name is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Datasets available for the projects in master’s degree over  Kaggle and GitHub are nothing closer to real-life data used at workplace. Rather than building a meaningful model,  directly out of dataset, we have to first spend most of our time pre-processing the data to keep it consistent before  analysing it. This tedious task involves cleaning up the data, removing outliers, encoding variables, and more. Data  preprocessing is often considered the worst part of a data scientist’s job, but it is important as the model is based on  this high-quality data only. Otherwise, the machine learning model will learn the wrong pattern, eventually leading to  the wrong prediction. Finally, after going through all these stages a data scientist reaches one of his biggest challenges,  which is to communicate the results to senior management. Managers and other stakeholders are unaware of the tools  and the works behind the model. They must make decisions based on the explanations provided by the data scientists.  If we cannot explain how the model affects the performance of their organization, our solution is then unlikely to be  implemented.  
"
reflection_assignment_P8,Level 3,2,2,"So far, before starting this course, I was defining and pursuing data science as mentioned above because  of my project-based approach, ignorant to think critically and use data in an ethically responsible manner just to deliver  what I was expected to is mainly because of lack of awareness amongst data scientist and other stake holders, not to  forget the distracting strict deadlines to be met resulting in not so optimal solutions.  
"
reflection_assignment_P8,Level 2 (a),2,2,"The course taught us how data scientists’ choices are involved at every stage of the data science workflow and show  how a human-centered approach can enhance each one, by making the process more transparent, asking questions,  and considering the social context of the data. How the tools from social science might be incorporated into data  science practices. It gave us the confidence that data science practitioners can build rigorous and ethical algorithms  and design projects that use cutting-edge computational tools and address social concerns. It has also introduced  best practices for addressing the bias and inequality that may result from the automated collection, analysis, and  distribution of very large datasets. Offered a brief and accessible overview of many common statistical and algorithmic  data science techniques, explained human-centered approaches to data science problems, and presented guidelines  and real-world case studies to help readers apply these methods. Human-Centered Data Science attempts, through a  combination of qualitative and quantitative metrics, to honor the compelling and inspiring stories of individuals in the  sea of aggregated data. The interdisciplinary field attempts to incorporate and contextualize the often-invisible but very  real people creating data points, as it attempts to give every datum a voice to tell its own story. A part of this process is  to acknowledge some sense of uncertainty, and subjective interpretations of meaning and context. The process also  considers the ethics, potential biases and harms that can occur from the process of aggregating and operating on large  sets of human-generated data. Such considerations are important and essential to the research process. It helps to  uncover social nuances or consider ethics and values in data usage to perform more meaningful data analyses to create  user-centric products that are thoughtful and intentional.  
"
reflection_assignment_P8,Level 3,2,3,"The major impact this course has brought on me is the shift  of my working approach from ‘move fast and break things’ to ‘slow down and be critical about these things, meaning  that data driven models can be built thoughtfully while recognizing various risks and potential issues down the line  in parallel, and brain storming for solutions to deal with them. As everything can be dealt qualitatively. Not only at  personal level has human-centered data science brought benefits, but it has played vital role towards the betterment  of society too by enabling data scientists to create products and services that resonate and are tailored to audience’s needs. With the goal to keep users’ wants, pain points, and preferences front of mind during every phase of the process.  In turn, they build more intuitive, accessible products that are likely to turn a higher profit because customers have  already vetted the solution and feel more invested in using it.   
"
reflection_assignment_P8,Level 3,3,3,"Previously, I considered data science focuses only on computational and statistical models to derive solutions or  develop products, but this new learning has managed to teach us how to integrate a human centered and societal  focus throughout the same process. It has provided us not only with the skills and knowledge to deal with complex,  large-scale data sets but I have also also gained knowledge in user-centred visualization, ethics and policies, and I  feel capable to assess social implications of any solution to an extent. My decision-making skillset has been greatly  influenced by this course, it has been shifted from model-based approach to deliver the end user what is best for them.  
"
reflection_assignment_P8,Level 3,3,3,"Biases are systematic errors in thinking, usually inherited by cultural and personal experiences, that lead to distortions  of perceptions when making decisions. And these effects only grow when people are used to training machine learning  models. The models inherit the bias of the people building them, and produce unexpected and harmful outcomes.  Therefore, fairness in data analysis is used to eliminate bias and programs should be designed in a way that respects the  rule of law, human rights, democratic values and diversity, and should include appropriate safeguards to ensure a fair  and just society.  
"
reflection_assignment_P8,Level 3,3,3,"Moving onwards, I am planning to adapt an approach towards model building that would ensure collaborative teamwork  and human-centric design. It will have to include careful design of user studies, the development of a prototype, and  the collaboration with domain experts. By making sure that the collected data about users in the field has employed  user-centered design process (interviews, surveys, etc.). I will try to interpret and consolidate the data in a structured  way, identify user needs, use the data to create and prototype product, and iteratively test and refine those concepts with  users. This will allow to better discover and articulate unbiased and fair user needs when they interact with machine  learning outputs. Human-Centered Data Science considers the ethics, potential biases and harms that can occur from  the process of aggregating and operating on large sets of human-generated data. Such considerations are important  and essential to the research process, with the view of adequately respecting the humans, thus, we all should consider  incorporating such methods into our practice.  
"
reflection_assignment_P8,Level 2 (b),3,3,"I have attended and participated in this course very actively and have enjoyed all the assignments throughout the  semester. The approach towards the teamwork in this course was very engaging and have allowed every individual to  learn the core purpose.  
"
reflection_assignment_P8,Level 2 (b),3,3,"I have enjoyed doing this assignment as it will reflect my perspective on this course and might  speak for how I got truly indulged with the course content. It took me almost a week to complete this assignment as  there was a lot to summarize what I had gained throughout the semester, plus this Latex tool was also new to me.  
"
reflection_assignment_P9,Level 1,1,1,"As a Data Scientist, the main task is to create a model based on the data. The usual practice is  to take the data, preprocess the data, perform feature engineering and create the model, and at  last evaluate the model based on the certain metric on unseen data. This all happens in an  interactive Jupyter notebook to get an insight into the data and model performance.  
"
reflection_assignment_P9,Level 1,1,1,"Workspace range from company projects to self-employed projects. If I’m working for a  company then definitely the work environment is regulated by company rules and regulations. I  have to adhere to their compliance policy. Projects range from client to client basic and it's a  real-time practical implementation that is dealt with by the customers or users daily. Like  developing a chatbot for bank employees so they can directly query the bank database using  Natural Language instead of writing the SQL query. Or creating a Machine Learning Model to  identify the fraud customers who will be not able to pay the debt back to the bank.  
"
reflection_assignment_P9,Level 2 (b),1,1,"Data is a real  problem when it comes to building an ML model in real-time situations. Data Security and the  unavailability of authentic data are the biggest obstacles in the path of building a model. The  company provides their license software or cloud platforms like AWS or GCP to write the code  and train the model, so in this way, they maintain the security and ownership of the project.  
"
reflection_assignment_P9,Level 1,1,1,"When I am working on a self-employed project or participating in Hackathon, there is no certain  measure is taken. The main objective is to make the Model train and get the desired metric  better. Mostly the data is acquired from an open source domain, so data will be preprocessed  up to a certain extent, so just writing the algorithm and some level of postprocessing is required.  From the tool perspective, Jupyter Lab is used as an interactive workspace.  
"
reflection_assignment_P9,Level 1,2,2,"There are several reasons to practice Data Science and it depends on many factors such as the  amount and quality of data, computing resources, problem use case, and productive time ratio.  If I am working on a DS project and data is in GB, it's not feasible enough to load the complete  dataset on local system RAM due to memory constraints. So here different practice comes into  play, either I have to load the data into small chunks and tune the algorithm to ingest it  accordingly or completely move to cloud services. If the project requires to use of the traditional  Machine Learning Algorithms then it can be run using CPU, with no required extra GPU power.  But if a project is more advanced like face recognition where transformers are getting used and  implemented, then I have to opt for GPU which is more reliable to perform on the cloud. Another  case can be Distributed Computing and Parallelism. If the client requires to use of the PySpark  framework, then it has to be gonna on a cloud platform to harness the juice out of the library. So  practice keeps changing based on the project's requirements, which framework is getting used,  and how much time is required to complete the task. How severe is the scope of the projects?  
"
reflection_assignment_P9,Level 1,2,2,"There is numerous concept which was encapsulated into the course. The main objective is to  make humans understand the data and the model. How much the model is explainable to  normal human beings and to what extent by keep other parameters intact? The course tries to  dissect the concepts into a much finer grain from the ethical point of view. How the output will  impact society? Is there any kind of bias in the data or model? How much model reflect the  trustworthy and explainable side? We try to interpret the model from the logical point of view, not  through the technical side. We try to question the output of the model, either it can be  generalized to the whole population, or it's only worth it for a small subset of the person due to  bias, and unfairness.  
"
reflection_assignment_P9,Level 3,2,2,"As Data scientists, we only consider the evaluation metric, we give more  importance to F1 score or accuracy but we never give a thought to real impact.  
"
reflection_assignment_P9,Level 3,2,2,"Many takeaways from the course but one biggest takeaway is that fairness. Previously I trained  the model regardless of taking into consideration of protected attributes like sex, age, and race.  Doesn’t give a second thought to whether this will impact the other data attributes or the final  predicted value. But after going through the concept, I realized these kinds of attributes should  be handled with utmost care and separately.  
"
reflection_assignment_P9,Level 3,2,3,"There was turnover at some points during the  course when going through the bias discrimination, and fairness. These concepts lead to the  foundation of ethical Data Science. As DS practitioners, we have to understand the concepts of  bias, how is it introduced, what its impact and the optimal ways to handle it.  
When concepts get clear and try to implement into the existing process then time is increased in  significant proportions.  
"
reflection_assignment_P9,Level 3,3,3,"Previously I was considerate only about the accuracy of the model but  now there are lots to keep in mind. The important thing is the data, the source of data, how data  is collected and under which circumstances, and how genuine and reliable the data is. When  come to feature engineering, here I have to consider the attributes and biases in the data. While  writing an algorithm or choosing a pre-existing library, I have to see the interpretability and  explainability of the model. It's not a good practice to simply train the model and don't know the  underlying working. So choosing the model should answer these questions regarding  transparency and Interpretability. So while keeping all these factors and then training the model,  it increased the time frame for developing one model or working on a project.  
"
reflection_assignment_P9,Level 1,3,3,"If the model is biased, then the prediction will not be accurate, it will always be against one  group of people so that group of people will never thrive and always be discriminated against.  
"
reflection_assignment_P9,Level 3,3,3,"Before going through the course content, I was developing collecting the data, performed EDA,  feed the data into the algorithm to create the model, run hyperparameter optimization to improve  the evaluation metric and take the unseen data and make the prediction out of the data. So it  was just a set of tasks to perform in a complete pipeline. Without going any further in  understanding or analyzing the depth of the outcome. I was mostly bothered about the output  regardless of how it impacts society, what the value the model is generating, apart from the  monetary advantage, is the model is also ethically proving itself. While back not think about all  these points and just developed them.  
"
reflection_assignment_P9,Level 3,3,3,"When implementing the course concepts in a real project, in starting it was difficult to  understand how fairness or bias to handle. Looking for some resources on the internet, and  reading blogs, as these concepts are relatively new. Many research papers or journals are  written and published but from practical aspects, it's still much more behind. There are not  enough open source libraries to implement these concepts. The decision leads to the  performance of the model, and how fair one attributes is above others. Which attributes most  impact the model decision? Now overall deciding factor is not only the accuracy but also the  value it creates.  
"
reflection_assignment_P9,Level 3,3,4,"Yes, the perception has been vastly impacted by the introduction of these concepts. A new way  of looking is introduced. As practitioners and from a technical point of view bias and fairness  are the most important factors above other factors such as values and privacy. For instance  suppose, there is a dataset that consists of multiple target labels and these are the proportions  
of 5:4:5:1. So to handle the imbalance data, either I remove the complete instance of less label  or make it null. But now I consider before performing those operations and think how these will  impact the model output. Its decision will be impacted by how much. So my scope view is  widened in depth. Analyzing every aspect of the code and doing it correctly whether stack  holders are with it or not. The more important is to put the result in a very transparent manner  not to hide or overlap the results by making some tweaks to improve the model performance.   
"
reflection_assignment_P9,Level 3,4,4,"While working on DS projects, I always make sure that the lecture concepts is in pipeline. From  the data side, bias and features are handled properly. When choosing the algorithm make sure  that the model is interpretable up to a certain extent and explainable. It shouldn’t be a complete  black box to understand. While presenting the report via visualization or through the table, it  should be clear and easy to grasp. Modular code should be written so it can be used for  different projects also.  
"
reflection_assignment_P9,Level 1,4,4,"To inculcate these things into daily DS work, there are different ways for different things. As for  writing the code, we can take help for an extension that formates the code and is representable  and self-explanatory. From model interpretability, Lime and sharp can be used for better  understanding. For analyzing the data fairness and bias, the ai360 library can be used which  gives a better analytical view.  
"
reflection_assignment_P9,Level 3,4,4,"The drawback of implementing all these things is time constraints. For every project, there is a  time set by the managers, so as developers we are restrained to deliver outcomes within the  given time frame. Sometimes these tasks (fairness, interpretability) doesn’t take the topmost  priority and leave behind. Other reasons are when presenting the transparent results to clients  or stakeholders, they are not boarded with the outcome which has further consequences.  
"
reflection_assignment_P9,Level 3,4,4,"As a Data Scientist, I feel these are good practices to include but sometimes these are too  overwhelming and create other effects.  
"
reflection_assignment_P9,Level 3,5,5,"The assignments are straightforward to implement and the task is distributed among the team  members. For individual tasks, it took on average 2 to 3 hrs to research and implement.  The assignments are useful as its directly related to the course lecture. One thing is to point out  that there should be an option to choose a library to implement. The ai360 library is not well  updated and it doesn’t support the new ARM architecture, so it takes more time to find a  workaround method.  
"
Reflection_assignment_P10,Level 2 (a),2,2,"I am a graduate in Computer Science and Engineering with around 6 years of experience in the field of application  development and Database management. Over the years, my relationship with data has evolved from a conventional  query optimisation, data modelling and data manipulation approach to more a dynamic domain like data scraping,  data visualisation, feature engineering to modelling Machine learning algorithms. This technical growth over the years  encouraged me to pursue Data Science and create a niche for myself in this exciting domain of endless opportunities  
"
Reflection_assignment_P10,Level 2 (b),2,2,"If I  have to highlight the relevance of Human Centered Data Science course in the form of a paraphrase in would say, HCDS  has been able to convincingly explain me the difference between a technical growth and an intellectual evolution. I, in  the following sections will try to justify this.  
"
Reflection_assignment_P10,Level 1,2,2,"Until recently, the approach to data related problems have been quite mechanical as depicted in the figure below. 
Fig. 2. Conventional Data Science Workflow 
This approach points us to the inherent understanding that we are dealing with numbers and data which are devoid  of emotions and are non-living entities. Such a notion is highly misplaced as in the age of extensive digitisation data  is nothing but our digital footprint. What we believe? How we react? What are the prevalent prejudices? Our strength  , weaknesses as well as our secrets, are all being tracked and recorded in perpetuity.  
"
Reflection_assignment_P10,Level 2 (a),3,3,"Even though there has been a passing debate on data ethics, the institutional framework - which could oversee dis-cussions,implementation and evolution of best practices concerning ethics is Data Science - has largely been missing.  This experience of mine is from India where Privacy is trivialised and at times not even considered as an unalienable  Human right  
"
Reflection_assignment_P10,Level 1,3,3,"As a Data Scientist, its easy to work in a unregulated setup given that the laws are not strict and the society at large has  a don’t care attitude towards inherent bias and privacy and institutions are largely unaccountable and non-transparent.  But Data Science practices devoid of ethics is a ticking time-bomb which can have severe consequences as evident from  Cambridge Analytica case.  
"
Reflection_assignment_P10,Level 1,3,3,"Human Centered Data Science course primarily seeks to inculcate Human-centered perspective which can then harness  the automated power of computational techniques on one end and simultaneously account for the highly situated and  nuanced nature of social activity on the other. It aims to achieve this by raising interest and provoking reflection at  every phase of Data Science workflow.  
"
Reflection_assignment_P10,Level 1,3,3,"Reflection is an overarching term which seeks to bring about a paradigm shift from a conventional approach of  ’Technically focused Data Science Practice’ to a more organic way that is ’Critical Technical Practice’. This is the only  way by which we can consciously honour and integrate human values like Fairness, Privacy, Accountability and Trans-parency and progressively understand the nuances associated with these and improve.  
"
Reflection_assignment_P10,Level 1,3,4,"In order to inculcate Human-Centred perspective the course proposes an essential intervention which is to under-stand the context of the data. This can only be achieved by integrating qualitative methods to existing quantitative approaches. This can be done by specialising in the respective domain knowledge. Domain knowledge can help un-derstand the nuances associated with the origin of data, notion of fairness and biases in the given context as well  as privacy concerns. Further, the principle of reproduciblity ensures that our work remains transparent and open to  scrutiny  
"
Reflection_assignment_P10,Level 3,4,4,"As an aspiring data scientist it brings about a much needed clarity in the scheme of data science workflow  in order to make problem solving essentially for the people, by the people and of the people. Eventually, in medium and  long run, this course is going to play a pivotal role in guiding me towards responsible AI and explainable AI.  
"
Reflection_assignment_P10,Level 2 (b),4,4,"What is certainly the most satisfying aspect of this course has been its application oriented approach. The assignments  handed over to us progressively gave us an overview of how ethical principles for instance Fairness, transparency,  explainable AI and privacy can be integrated into the data science workflow. Playing around with protected attributes,  bias mitigation strategies and LIME gave us a new perspective in the field of data science.  
"
Reflection_assignment_P10,Level 2 (a),4,4,"The lectures and assignments  on Explainable AI shattered my (mis)understanding that data science is largely based on black box approach.  
"
Reflection_assignment_P10,Level 2 (b),4,4,"The assignment on reproducibility provided us with first hand experience to replicate the findings of the research paper  and understand why reproducibility is the fundamental basis of any research work.  
"
Reflection_assignment_P10,Level 2 (b),4,4,"I always heard about algorithms  being unfair to certain gender, ethno-linguistic groups and religious minorities. The concept of protected attributes  which seems so trivial once understood explained to us how algorithms actually mimics human prejudices and bias  and what changes we need to incorporate in order to make AI systems fairer and more objective. While I had over the  years came across several literature talking about AI induced biases and discrimination along with breach of privacy,  diving into the technical aspects of these to understand their implementation and associated challenges have been an  invaluable takeaway from this course.  
"
Reflection_assignment_P10,Level 3,4,4,"Given the fact that ethics in Data Science domain is still evolving, the notion of shared ethos, personal values and  values of stakeholders taught in this course will serve as an important guiding light to enhance the trust and credibility  of AI systems viz-a-viz prevalent social-cultural and political landscape. In the same context it becomes important to  conform our Data Science practice to changing regulatory regime. With the advent of GDPR regulations the need to  comply with legal norms in order to be in the game has been formally established. Most importantly, ethical principles  like utilitarianism and deontology will hereby shape my own values and provide me a moral basis to stand by them in  situations when my personal ethos will be in conflict with the organisational ethos and vested interests.  
"
Reflection_assignment_P10,Level 3,4,4,"This epoch of Artificial Intelligence is perhaps the most significant aspect of the present Anthropocene era. While we  are all aware of its immense potential, success of this technology lies in how well we are able to address the ethical  concerns arising from it. My future data science practice will now be a conscious one with not just my all brain but  also all heart into it.  
"
Reflection_assignment_P10,Level 3,4,4,"The course has provided me a good starting point to ponder upon different aspects of data driven decision making  and even challenge the existing ones based on the accepted ethical benchmarks. I see within myself a strategic shift  from a technology centred perspective to a human centred approach. Technology is for humans, human are not for  the technology. The society which gets overwhelmed by the technology will only be enslaved by its own creation. This  course is all about ensuring that human intelligence prevails artificial ones.  
"
Reflection_assignment_P10,Level 3,4,5,"I also understand that the domain of explainable AI, Fairness and Bias are relatively new where new changes are  witnessed every passing day. It is true that we learnt important concepts and tools like bias mitigation strategies and LIME which is a humble starting point. But this is just a tip of an ever evolving iceberg and I need to build from  here to catch up with the new developments and unlearn the obsolete ones in order to keep my data science practices  accountable, fair and eventually credible.   
"
Reflection_assignment_P10,Level 3,5,5,"When I enrolled for Human Centered Data Science as a part of our Ethics module I had an impression that it will be  dry and largely non-technical. My naive mind could not convincingly accept the hypothesis that philosophical under-pinnings like Fairness, Privacy and Virtues can actually be integrated into technology. I always considered technology as  neutral and this has been the fundamental mistake in accessing it viz-a-viz Human values and ethical benchmarks. I  can now firmly assert that technology mimics Human race and a conscious, concrete and continuous effort is needed to  make this geological epoch more dignified, fair, just, accountable and transparent besides being efficient, faster and  convenient. To sum up, I can now confidently say, the world of Data Science for me will not be the same as before and  the culture of reflection inculcated through this course will make Data Science practices more organic and evolutionary  just like Human endeavours and relationships.  
"
reflection_assignment_P11,Level 1,1,1,"I’m a graduate of Computer Science and have one and a half years of experience in Data Science.  I have extensive experience in using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, especially in  supervised learning. My skills before taking this course were not just limited to applying and  optimizing ML Algorithms but also to data analytics and statistical tests to find key statistics  and visualize insights. In short, I had enough and only technical skills.  
"
reflection_assignment_P11,Level 1,1,2,"If I talk about HCDS, it has explained the ethical perspectives like intellectual evolution and its difference with technical  broadening. In the later sections, I will dig deeper to explain my projects and their workflows.  
"
reflection_assignment_P11,Level 1,2,2,"I completed a final year project in machine learning that was about providing a route planner  system to residents of New York to plan the best trips in future three days. The data was collected 
from Uber Movement and it was a self-supervised learning system that got good accuracy  
"
reflection_assignment_P11,Level 1,2,2,"Afterwards, I completed several data science projects in biomedical, financial and information  systems. Where I utilised my skills to solve different problems.  
"
reflection_assignment_P11,Level 1,2,3,"In my ongoing master’s program,  I have completed some advanced courses in the first semester like Programming, Statistics and  Machine Learning in Data Science that has given me the confidence to think statistically and  use appropriate techniques (algorithms) to address different problems using Python as a primary  language. And I just got to learn only the technical approach to solving issues. Following is the  traditional life cycle I used before taking this course: 
Fig. 1. Workflow of my previous Data Science practice  
As we can see in figure 1, as in industry I also followed the same sequence of workflow to solve  problems in data science.   
"
reflection_assignment_P11,Level 3,3,3,"Another interesting project was adult income classification and which was a mandatory project  in the Machine Learning course of this master’s program. The project aimed to predict adult in-come based on customer data. I adopted the traditional approach of the data science life cycle 
to accomplish the goal. But, I noticed problems arose when the model was biased towards some  specific classes. Like, in the last semester, when I completed the project(Adult Income Classifica-tion) in ML. I found out that the model was biased toward Male Gender, and its True Positive Rate  (TPR) ratio is much greater than of Female ratio.  
"
reflection_assignment_P11,Level 3,3,3,"Also, there are outdated datasets (like German  Credit Data) that seem incorrect because some important information (like data collection proce-dure) is hidden and no clue about how data was collected. There was a lack of transparency in 
previous practice. The reason was that there was less often awareness about these ethical perspec-tives in the industry where we are supposed to use the traditional lifecycle without any ethical 
concern, which is used to solve specific tasks.  
"
reflection_assignment_P11,Level 3,3,3,"I’m grateful to take this course for my master’s to get a deeper understanding of the ethical aspects  of data science. The human-Centered approach has enabled me to think critically and use data in 
an ethically responsible manner so that the data science practice can be socially acceptable.  
"
reflection_assignment_P11,Level 1,3,3,"It  introduces various interventions in different stages of the technical workflow of data science.  These interventions are illustrated in the following figure: 
As we can see in figure 2, at each stage there is a proposed intervention to eliminate bias and  make the process fair. It’s necessary to understand the data collection process to authenticate the  data quality as well as its authenticity and after that making it fair by removing bias is mandatory  to make the data science practice ethical.  
"
reflection_assignment_P11,Level 1,3,3,"Reproducible workflow ensures results obtained in the  same experiment should be achieved again with higher reliability, similarly Explainable AI helps  interpret the model to technical persons while using its interface helps explain the working of the  model to non-technical users as well.  
"
reflection_assignment_P11,Level 3,3,4,"This course has changed my thinking and view about ethical aspects of data science and helped 
me to think critically about technical practice during the whole life cycle. I heard in past that AI  will automate different kinds of jobs and so reduce the jobs in different sectors. But in this course,  I got to learn that in companies when building an AI system, developers don’t take care of ethical  aspects, and it might be due to less awareness about data ethics or maybe a wrong belief that  technology is neutral. In this course, I got to learn and understand that Technology is neither good  nor bad; nor is it neutral. An example was given where a biased model recognize people with black

faces as gorillas, etc. So, we have to remove the bias and get a balance proportion or maybe use  bias mitigation techniques to remove the bias. Fairness, Accountability and Transparency are the  human values that can be honoured through this way of critical practice.   
"
reflection_assignment_P11,Level 1,4,4,"Transparency is important to make fair decisions, it describes openness, interpretability and  algorithmic transparency. Interpretability is defined as an ability to explain or to present in un-derstandable terms to a human. It further explores interpretable machine learning and its use to  explain how the model works. I studied different characteristics of model interpretability and its  approaches to making complex models interpretable, it also improves transparency. Intrinsic and  Post-hoc are the most useful interpretability techniques. Intrinsic interpretability techniques refer  to models that can be interpreted by themselves, they are transparent and it’s most models are  model-specific. While Post-hoc techniques refer to explanation methods that are used to create  explanations, it’s most methods are model agnostic(i.e. LIME). There are various tools available,  like Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), to explain the working of models.  Based on the heuristic approach, LIME makes fast computations and can explain textual and im-age data, it aims to help users by explaining individual predictions using interactive plots. Here  is an example of a LIME explanation: subcaption 
As we can see in Figure 5, shows the coefficients and their weightage to the output  
"
reflection_assignment_P11,Level 3,5,5,"As I mentioned earlier in explaining my projects that while having data pre-processed I applied  the ML Algorithms and I got very good accuracy and other scores as well. But after studying  this course, I re-run the projects again and wondered to see that my models were biased towards  specific gender (i.e. Male) due to its large proportion of data and noticed similar mistakes with  other projects as well where I didn’t care about protected attributes.  
"
reflection_assignment_P11,Level 3,5,6,"This course is very helpful 
and has changed my views and decision-making toward data science practice. The more satisfying part was its practical implementation of concepts, like solving such problems in tutorials. And the  tutorial exercises gave us an overview of how ethical principles can be integrated into the data  science workflow.   
"
reflection_assignment_P11,Level 3,6,6,"As I discussed earlier, I had no intuition about how AI without ethics can harm society, I got  the new learning. In my point of view, it’s very important and mandatory to consider ethics  and values in AI so that the developed system can have no negative impact (discrimination) on  people. Similarly, Bias should be mitigated in Data Science projects and Fairness is ensured in  complete data science practice so that models can’t consider sensitive variables (like gender, eth-nicity, colour, etc.) for decision-making. I learned about protected attributes and why we should  avoid using them as the basis for decision-making. Recently, I eliminated protected attributes in  my projects that were discriminating in predicting adult income projects and some other projects  too.  
"
reflection_assignment_P11,Level 1,6,6,"I learned to use different mitigation strategies( i.e. pre-processing, in-processing and post-processing),  to eliminate the bias and make the data science practice (or model) fair. Bias mitigation strategies  and LIME gave us a new viewpoint in the field of data science.  
"
reflection_assignment_P11,Level 2 (b),6,6,"Both lectures and assignments  introduced some techniques to interpret and explain the ML algorithms that previously seemed  to be a black box to me, but now with the use of Explainable AI utilities like LIME and SHAP I’m  capable to distinguish the impactful features by visualizing their coefficients. Here is an example  that illustrates the contribution of features to a model’s prediction: 
Fig. 6. LIME Explaination 
In the above figure 5, the class of the instance is ’Christian’ and the coefficients and their values  are visualized to analyse how and which features are influencing this class. Similarly, such figures  are interesting to analyse the feature importance and help us in decision-making to consider the  features that contributed more to predicting any class.  
"
reflection_assignment_P11,Level 3,7,7,"I got a Data Scientist job, in the banking sector, recently that will start next month. I will utilize  all the learnings there to apply the technology-centred perspective to a human-centred approach  to make the system trustworthy and socially acceptable. I will also ensure transparency and ac-countability to make data-driven decision-making ethically fair. To make the system fair, I will  not use the attributes for decision-making that discriminate against people of different classes,  races, ethnicity and gender. Not just limited to my job but in any upcoming project, I will start  to apply this new practice and consider ethics and its principles, Bias Mitigation techniques and  Fairness in my practice to ensure that my data and model should be fair.  
"
reflection_assignment_P11,Level 3,7,7,"Also, I will take into ac-count Transparency and Reproducibility for a reliable workflow to achieve the same results with  the same code. To better interpret the model and explain it to end-users I will use LIME and SHAP  to make it easy to understand the working of the model and feature’s coefficients. Privacy is also  an important aspect of the practice, so I have learned to ensure user information should not be  made available on digital platforms to avoid it being traceable by anyone.  
"
reflection_assignment_P11,Level 3,7,7,"By knowing GDPR, I understand the data storage permissions and rules. It is used to enhance  EU citizens’ control over the personal data that companies can legally hold. But such regulations  are only limited to their regions. It helped me to understand why it’s necessary to store such  information. Using this practice, I will ensure the privacy of people and their trust in my practice  and using Explainable AI methods, the quality of practice will further increase. So in general, it  will eventually come up as best practice that ensures quality and ethics.  
"
reflection_assignment_P11,Level 3,7,7,"Before this course, based on the description, I believed that it will help prepare me to use ethics  in data science practice and will get to know about Explainable AI methods. After completing  this course, I can say that it was an interesting and innovative course that is a need of modern  data science practice. Its techniques should be a part of every data science project to make AI  trustworthy AI for every project. And eventually, people will practice AI without compromising  their privacy. In this way, the whole world will trust AI because it will prohibit discrimination.  I will not make false assumptions as before but rather with the new concepts and techniques of  Explainable AI I will interpret the algorithms working better and make better explanations while  speaking to non-technical people (clients) and so help them understand the working of the built  system. In future, I will implement the new data science practice(integrated with the learning of  this course).  
"
reflection_assignment_P11,Level 3,7,8,"I’m confident to say that I got to learn so many things. My initial perception of the course was that  it was non-technical and theoretical. But I’m amazed to see the latest content and well-balanced structure that provides theoretical understanding as well as their implementation to make con-cepts strong and I will remember the concepts always as I implemented the concepts on my own.  I got to acknowledge that Technology is neither good, bad or neutral, humans are. And it is our re-sponsibility to ensure fairness in AI to make it socially acceptable. I’m very satisfied and feel happy  to say that I took most of it and I like the structure of the Theoretical and Practical Implementation 
of concepts. The course can be further improved by using Docker for the Reproducibility section. 
It took me more than a week to brainstorm and write comprehensively for this reflection essay.  
"
reflection_assignment_P12,Level 3,2,2,"I was aware of the racial bias in US health care system and how women are treated unfairly in the world designed  by men. Although practicing ethics and looking for racial bias was never my primary focus while doing data science  related work. My focus area has been how to streamline and make the model more perfect, which I realize would result  in biased output as the data would itself be biased.  
"
reflection_assignment_P12,Level 2 (b),2,2,"I have worked in insurance industry where privacy of customer was given utmost importance. Given a new data  set, I was instructed to look for any potential privacy leak and report and mask it as soon as possible. Reproducibility  was practiced in work area as multiple peer reviews were done and logging of each day’s work was mandatory. These  practices helped me in laying a strong base for my professional career when it comes to understanding the possibilities/  aftermath of data violations. Although directly not involved, I understand how insurance companies highly charge the  customers who are not likely to leave the business.  
"
reflection_assignment_P12,Level 1,2,2,"In the days of technology innovations, computers are being manipulated with programs to act more like people and  eventually and eventually several social and ethical come into focus related to computer programming or artificial  intelligence.  
"
reflection_assignment_P12,Level 3,2,2,"The focus in my prior experience has been to be more efficient with the given data, while the trade off between fairness  and efficiency was never considered. In retrospective, it was not a norm to look at data from its future implications  perspective. As a junior employee, the focus would primarily be to perform well and the growth of the company would  be the only focus.  
"
reflection_assignment_P12,Level 1,2,2,"Organizations that utilize data can amass valuable information on clients habits and preferences, behaviour patterns,  purchase patterns etc which can be misused. Like all technology Big Data, AI and ML applications can be ethically  challenging to implement.  
"
reflection_assignment_P12,Level 2 (b),2,2,"For me, the HCDS course has given multidimensional view of data science practices.  Considering the different stakeholders, where to draw hard line, what could be some gray areas where nobody is right  or wrong. These discussions were an eye opener for me. The negative impacts of data related work were lesser known  to me; It spans over many facets of life: college rankings, employment application screeners, policing and sentencing  algorithms, workplace wellness programs, and the many inappropriate ways credit scores reward the rich and punish  the poor. It was furthermore interesting to note that the variables which may appear to be neutral can make biased  decisions.

"
reflection_assignment_P12,Level 2 (a),2,2,"This awakening enforces the need to stop, think and check the work and its implications at each stage. HCDS  laid a strong foundation on the need to stop and think at every step of the work. The overall big picture of each work  needs to be considered at the same time the implications of the work should be given equal priority  
"
reflection_assignment_P12,Level 3,2,2,"The examples  given on how big corporates had to withdraw some unethical projects as they faced protests from their employees were  inspiring. The power of an employee and the power of whistle blowing policies should not be underestimated. While  working, be it on small scale these things had never crossed my mind. The course has helped me in identifying the  potential one employee has over identifying such discriminations and manipulations done by corporates.  
"
reflection_assignment_P12,Level 2 (a),2,2,"New methods  of data analysis and artificial intelligence are sprouting up every day, change is the only constant in such an arena.  The constant evolution needs to be constantly studied and discussed and should not be belittled.  
"
reflection_assignment_P12,Level 2 (a),2,2,"It was intriguing to  learn about the man induced disasters that humankind is currently facing in different data related arenas. Reaching a  mid-way which is safe for mankind and useful and beneficial to the stakeholders is the primary target one needs to  have, all this while having moral high ground.  
"
reflection_assignment_P12,Level 3,3,3,"In any business, one needs to study what is happening currently to improve. The biasedness in the data, or the violation  of individual’s privacy were not taken seriously until recently. The growth in technology should not be pushing  someone/community behind. The conflict would come with the funding and the purpose of the tasks/projects. Wrong  usage of data can lead to human induced disasters, which we might turn back and call blunders. The main challenge  regarding the area is the lack of strict legal measures which makes it flexible for individuals or corporates to streamline  their policies which might be harmful or destructive to some. In many circumstances, people are not aware that the  data is getting collected without explicit consent; neither it is known to people how the data would be used. Statistics  are a kind of information, so is human experience. To design a world, that is meant to work for everyone or at least  harmless to fellow beings would need thorough reviewing and discussions. Today’s laws protect data that are explicit.  However, there is no legal or normative protection for data that is implicit and non-confidential. Data mining can also  reveal sensitive information that is derived from non-sensitive data and Meta data – the so-called inference problem.  Big data may provide information and insights that contribute to socio-economic development in various forms such as  industry trends that simulate growth and empower people with research insight to solve social problems, diagnose  economic imbalances, spread awareness of new events and products, provide voice to people whose voice would be  unheard otherwise.  
"
reflection_assignment_P12,Level 1,3,3,"The initiative to put ethical implications of data science in the curriculum is a huge stepping stone to influence the future 
data scientists. From data cleaning to final model, each step needs to be thoroughly checked for its wider implications  
"
reflection_assignment_P12,Level 3,3,3,"I  believe my data science practice, unlike before, would not merely focus on the commercialized goal. The focus on data  would be of utmost importance to me. The default gender in data historically has been men. The underrepresented  communities should be focused, and analysis should be streamlined in a way to address such disparities.  
"
reflection_assignment_P12,Level 3,3,3,"The important  change in my approach in working style would be the acceptance that things could go wrong at any and each step of  a project. The data itself and the analysis/analysts or even the corporate should not be solely trusted with decision  making process. The data and the analysis should merely be a tool in making decisions. The human centered data  science was an eye opener in realizing that simply excluding certain features would not help in keeping up the ethical  standards. The new methods of data driven work throw up unexpected challenges and opportunities and place old  problems in a new light. The conflict that I see in my real-life data related work would be, if it is solely my responsibility  or some government rules and restrictions need to be actively in place to have a safe environment which would not  discriminate any  
"
reflection_assignment_P12,Level 3,3,3,"The introductory course in ethics would help every individual to have ethical viewpoint also as a  focus area while working on a project. Power and responsibility of each individual is reinforced through this course,  which was earlier unaware to the wider student community while starting a job.
